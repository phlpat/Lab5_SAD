I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\\n\",\n",

Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.

              " '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 \\n04:26 PM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM\\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.

This would produce an average sq\\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\\nfor $203,108.\\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\\npreferences.\\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\\nif she will be ok in the long run.\\nGeorge W.

Exodus, ICG \\nCommunications,\\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \\nNetworks all\\n                  lease space in the office park. \\n\\n                       After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \\nSabey has become an\\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\nmanagement or\\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \\nclaims his firm is\\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\nthe country. \\n\\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \\nbandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\nco-location space in\\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \\n\\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\nspace is growing at a\\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\ncausing similar\\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\nCalifornia. \\n\\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\nspace, plans to nearly\\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\nWhile companies\\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\nhigh-tech companies\\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\nas Exodus that\\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\nmanagement. \\n\\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\nconstruction and we plan to\\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\ndemand right now\\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\nexecutive at Exodus in\\n                  Seattle. \\n\\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \\nin the local utility\\n                  industry perplexed. \\n\\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\nto serve the growth,\"\\n                  said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\nalmost stunned by this, in\\n                  a way.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The \\nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \\nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \\nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \\nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \\nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \\nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \\nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \\nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \\nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\nthe generation side.\\n\\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \\nthey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \\nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \\nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\\n\\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \\nothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gas \\ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \\nespecially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the \\nUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal \\nconsumer then it is obviously a different story.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk.\\n',\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \\nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \\nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \\nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \\nI'll take care of it..\\n\\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \\ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \\n$235,019.   \\n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \\n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \\nGDP-Kingsgate.\\n\\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \\ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \\nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \\nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \\nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \\nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \\nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \\nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \\nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \\ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \\nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \\nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \\nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \\ncase there's something you want to do about it.

I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\\n\\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California\\'s problems to the West\\n\\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.

Any possibility for a \\ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\ndifficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\ndisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n \\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n \\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\nCurrent Projected \\nBlended IR:  5.38%\\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\nidea  earlier in the crisis.\\n \\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \\nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \\npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \\nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \\nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n\\n',\n",

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \\nclient will be configured on your computer.\\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \\nvia Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \\nconfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \\nmigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \\nweb browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \\nTo-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \\nclient is configured on your desktop.\\n\\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) \\nfor remote access to your mailbox.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while \\nconnecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA \\navailable from your home or when traveling abroad.\\n\\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\\n\\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  \\nhttp://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\\n\\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \\nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \\nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \\ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \\ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \\ncompared with the previous year.\\n\\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \\nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \\nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \\ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \\nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \\nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \\ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \\nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \\nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \\nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \\neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \\nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\\n\\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \\nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \\n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \\nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \\ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \\nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \\nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \\nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \\nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \\nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \\nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \\nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'s \\neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \\nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \\nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \\nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \\nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \\n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\\n\\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \\nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \\nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\nquestions or need any further information.\\n',\n",

Enron Center garage.\\n\\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \\nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \\ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \\ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \\nemployee cost of $94.00.\\n\\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \\nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \\nas spaces become available. \\n\\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \\nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

According to BPA,\\nit had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet\\nbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in\\norder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had\\nbeen telling California\\'s Department of Water Resources that the\\nsales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.\\n\\nCal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than\\nyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.\\nYesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because\\nof concerns about its water reserves.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \\n500+\\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \\nthis,\\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\\n\\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\\n\\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\\n\\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank\\'s Adjustment\\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\\n\\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\\nturn over.\\n\\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\\n\\n4.  Based on the Bank\\'s revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \\ndebt\\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\\n\\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\\n\\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\\n\\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\\n     Total                    $2,955,938\\n\\n7.

Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) \\nwill\\nbe in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the\\nacceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma\\nperformance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit\\nofficer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer\\nsigning off on the deal.\\n\\n3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers\\ndeferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as\\ndeferred profit has been acceptable.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nAndrew Ozuna\\nReal Estate Loan Officer\\n210-271-8386\\n##\\n\\n\\n',\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\\nBut that still wasn\\'t enough juice.\\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\\n$250/MWh price cap.\\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\\nPowerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\\nWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\\nwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\\nDorinson said.\\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\\nthe high-priced power.\\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said.

(SOE)\\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\\nevening.\\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\\nAES told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspection\\nof the company\\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\\nmorning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\\nThomas said.\\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representatives\\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\\n\\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\\n\\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\\nThomas said.\\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\\nand Redondo Beach plants.\\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\\n\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"\\nThomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\\ndistrict\\'s\" authority.\\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\\n\\n   Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\\n\\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\\nWednesday.\\n\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if you\\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegy\\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\\n\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation of\\nwhy its units were off line.\\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\\n\\n\\nG_nther A.

              " \"Jeff,\\n\\nBefore you write off the stage, a few things to think about.\\n\\n1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \\nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \\ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \\nrepairs.\\n\\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \\nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \\ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \\nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \\nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \\nonsite.\\n\\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \\nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\\n\\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \\nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\\n\\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \\ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\\n\\n\\nSales Price  705,000\\n\\n1st Lien   473,500\\n\\n2nd Lien  225,000\\n\\nTransfer fee    7,500\\n\\nCash required   14,500\\n\\n\\nNOI   100,000\\n\\n1st Lien    47,292\\n\\n2nd Lien   23,694\\n\\nCash flow  29,014\\n\\nCash on cash  200%\\n\\n\\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \\ncash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the \\nadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \\nfor a higher price.\\n\\nDo you want to reconsider?  Let me know.\\n\\nPhillip\\n\",\n",

Cash Needs\\nHighlights:\\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\\nplete=20\\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\\ns=20\\nand other measures.=20\\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\\n.8=20\\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\\nII. Credit Relationships\\nHighlights:\\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\\nlt.=20\\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\\nnd=20\\npayable.\\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\\n=20\\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\\nits=20\\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\\n=20\\nissues within the last three weeks.\\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\\nHighlights\\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\\n such=20\\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\\nHighlights\\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\\n=20\\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\\nTotal                                             $ 460\\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\\n=20\\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\\nom=20\\ncontract employees.\\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\\n=20\\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\\nActivity)\\nHighlights:\\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\\n=20\\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\\ne=20\\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\\n=20\\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\\nD.01-01-018.\\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\\nTURN Proposal\\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\\nRN=20\\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\\ns.=20\\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\\nt=20\\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\\nift=20\\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\\n the=20\\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\\nin=20\\nthe TRA is overstated.\\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\\nHighlights:\\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\\n=20\\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\\n=20\\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\\n=20\\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\\non=20\\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\\nve=20\\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\\n[there is no Section VII]\\n=20\\nVIII.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \\ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \\nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \\nwhat, I\\'m not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \\nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \\nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \\n(and maybe earlier).\\n\\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \\nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \\nsome assurances of payment. \\n\\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \\non 2/2/01.\\n\\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E\\'s \\npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \\n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \\nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \\noccurred today.\\n\\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \\nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \\nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg\\'s new bill .

In attendance were Ken Lay, \\nthe Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \\nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \\nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \\nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \\nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \\nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \\nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \\nproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \\nbased on the governor\\'s comments:\\n\\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \\nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \\ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \\ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \\nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \\nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \\ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \\nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \\nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \\nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \\n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \\nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \\nthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.\\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \\nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \\ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \\ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \\nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \\nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \\nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \\nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \\npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \\nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \\nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \\nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \\ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \\nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \\nwas a frequently recurring theme.\\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \\nbasis to consumers.\\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \\nCalifornia.\\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \\nwidely deploy distributed generation.\\nExpand in-state gas production.\\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \\naddtional gas supplies.\\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \\nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \\nany one time.\\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \\nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should be \\nable to help out here).\\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \\nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \\nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \\nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \\napproach with generators.\\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I\\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\\'s \\nthoughts and get them to Kari)\\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \\nnot just the 5 one year strips.\\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \\ndeal.\\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \\nforward contracting issues.\\nThanks to everyone for their help.

Any possibility for a=\\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=\\nans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=\\nus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=\\nans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=\\nnce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=\\n dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=\\nislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=\\ne details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=\\ne.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=\\ng-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=\\nhat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =\\nbreach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=\\ne bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=\\nll be very difficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=\\ne would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=\\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =\\n$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =\\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=\\nl disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the =\\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=\\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =\\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=\\nll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=\\nk of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=\\nr community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=\\nended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=\\nntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should get =\\npaid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=\\nkely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20\\n=20\\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=\\nans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =\\nthe General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =\\nof the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=\\nicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=\\n to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=\\nrtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=\\nications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n=20\\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B\\nLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B\\n=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B\\n=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%\\n=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%\\nCurrent Projected=20\\nBlended IR:=09=095.38%\\nMaturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=\\nhe California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=\\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=\\nhorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=\\ntional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =\\ngoing forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=\\nations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =\\nhas  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =\\nthat must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=\\nurther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =\\nis clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=\\ning power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=\\nornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=\\ndered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=\\nier in the crisis.\\n=20\\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=\\nhe first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =\\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=\\ngust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=\\no sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=\\nigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=\\ns and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=\\nes that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=\\nruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20\\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=\\nsuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=\\ntating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=\\nen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=\\nate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=\\nassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=\\n bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=\\n the DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n\\n',\n",

Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \\nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \\non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \\nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \\nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \\ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \\nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \\narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \\nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \\nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \\nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \\nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \\nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \\nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \\nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \\nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \\nproject.\\n\\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \\ngood.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \\nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \\non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \\nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \\nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \\ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \\nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \\narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \\nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \\nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \\nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \\nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \\nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \\nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \\nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \\nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \\nproject.\\n\\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \\ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \\nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\\n\\nRichard  \\n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 \\n08:34 AM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nAllan Severude\\n10/05/2000 06:03 PM\\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \\nMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT \\nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\\n\\n\\nFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \\npositions, I think we still have the following issues:\\nWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had \\nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \\ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \\nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \\nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\\n\\nThings left to do:\\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \\nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \\nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \\nproject and which fall out of scope.\\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \\nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \\ndrill downs.\\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\\n\\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \\nticker.\\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \\nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \\ntransport, swaps, options, ...\\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \\nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \\nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \\nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \\nappropriate positions to show for each:\\nGas Daily for monthly index,\\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \\nusing official valuations.\\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility \\nskew and correlations.\\nAbility to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \\nApproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \\ngamma grid.\\nValuation of Gas Daily options.\\nA new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.\\nInclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\\nAbility to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \\nmanager.\\nAbility to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, \\nprior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.\\nEliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.\\nPosition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \\nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\\nBenchmark positions in TDS.\\nDeployment of TDS in Canada.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nGeorge Richards\\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n - winmail.dat\\n',\n",

Exodus is now wrapping up \\nconstruction\\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \\na mile from its\\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \\nfiber optic backbones, the\\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\neventually\\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \\nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \\n\\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \\ncenters near Seattle.\\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \\nGlobix and\\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\nthe networking\\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \\n\\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \\neverything from your\\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\nyour favorite Web sites.\\n\\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\nserver farms, are\\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \\nValley that some\\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \\nPuget Sound\\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\nhigh-security\\n                  facilities. \\n\\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \\nare requesting 445\\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \\nsaid Karl\\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \\nEnergy. \"That is\\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \\n\\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \\nthe rise of the Internet\\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\nheads. \\n\\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \\nUtilities and\\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \\ndata centers. The\\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\nresidential and business\\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\nnecessary to support\\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\nmillion each,\\n                  Karzmar said. \\n\\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \\nbring up the data center\\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \\n\\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \\nbusinesses and schools in the\\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n\\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\nappetite for power --\\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \\nfacilities run 24 hours a\\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\nconstant revenue\\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \\nthey could\\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\nexpenditures. \\n\\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\nmean for power rates\\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \\n\\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \\nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \\nCity Light. \\n\\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \\nlights at the football\\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \\nWe have data\\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \\nand 50 megawatts.\" \\n\\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \\ncomplex in Tukwila is\\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \\nthe 1.35 million\\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \\nBoeing Space &\\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n92 percent of the\\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \\ncompanies. \\n\\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \\ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \\nCommunications,\\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \\nNetworks all\\n                  lease space in the office park. \\n\\n                       After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \\nSabey has become an\\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\nmanagement or\\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \\nclaims his firm is\\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\nthe country. \\n\\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \\nbandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\nco-location space in\\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \\n\\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\nspace is growing at a\\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\ncausing similar\\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\nCalifornia. \\n\\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\nspace, plans to nearly\\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\nWhile companies\\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\nhigh-tech companies\\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\nas Exodus that\\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\nmanagement. \\n\\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\nconstruction and we plan to\\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\ndemand right now\\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\nexecutive at Exodus in\\n                  Seattle. \\n\\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \\nin the local utility\\n                  industry perplexed. \\n\\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\nto serve the growth,\"\\n                  said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\nalmost stunned by this, in\\n                  a way.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The \\nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \\nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \\nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \\nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \\nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \\nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \\nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \\nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \\nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\nthe generation side.\\n\\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \\nthey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \\nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \\nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\\n\\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \\nothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gas \\ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \\nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \\nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \\nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \\nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \\nI'll take care of it..\\n\\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \\ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \\n$235,019.   \\n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \\n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \\nGDP-Kingsgate.\\n\\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \\ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \\nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \\nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \\nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \\nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \\nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \\nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \\nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.

Any possibility for a \\ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\ndifficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\ndisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n \\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n \\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\nCurrent Projected \\nBlended IR:  5.38%\\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\nidea  earlier in the crisis.\\n \\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \\nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \\npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \\nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \\nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n\\n',\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \\nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \\nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \\ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \\ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \\ncompared with the previous year.\\n\\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \\nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \\nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \\ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \\nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \\nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \\ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \\nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \\nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \\nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \\neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \\nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\\n\\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \\nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \\n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \\nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \\ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \\nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \\nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \\nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \\nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \\nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \\nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \\nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'s \\neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \\nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \\nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \\nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \\nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \\n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\\n\\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \\nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \\nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\nquestions or need any further information.\\n',\n",

soon.\\n\\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \\nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \\noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\\n\\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \\nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \\ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \\ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \\nemployee cost of $94.00.\\n\\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \\nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \\nas spaces become available. \\n\\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \\nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\\nBut that still wasn\\'t enough juice.\\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\\n$250/MWh price cap.\\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\\nPowerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\\nWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\\nwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\\nDorinson said.\\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\\nthe high-priced power.\\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retail\\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\\nPwr Plant\\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\\nCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,\\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\\nISO.\\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\\ncollapse.

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \\ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\\n\\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \\nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \\nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \\nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \\nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \\n\\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \\npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \\nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \\nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \\nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \\nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \\nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \\nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \\nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \\nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \\nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.?

However, if you accept the terms of this buyout \\noffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are \\nprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? \\nIf this is your \\n\\n\\n\\nchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, \\nClaudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.?

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \\ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\\n\\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \\nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \\nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \\nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \\nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \\n\\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \\npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \\nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \\nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \\nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \\nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \\nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \\nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \\nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \\nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \\nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \\nattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \\nthe total net buyout to $78,946.? \\n\\nWe still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \\noffer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout \\noffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are \\nprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? \\nIf this is your \\n\\n\\n\\nchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, \\nClaudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then \\ndraft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the \\nBishops Corner, Ltd.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \\n500+\\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \\nthis,\\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\\n\\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\\n\\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\\n\\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank\\'s Adjustment\\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\\n\\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\\nturn over.\\n\\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\\n\\n4.  Based on the Bank\\'s revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \\ndebt\\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\\n\\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\\n\\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\\n\\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\\n     Total                    $2,955,938\\n\\n7.

Finally \\nthe builders profit of 1.4 million.\\n\\nKeith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \\nof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \\nthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \\nWe were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \\nto the superintendent costs.

              " \"Jeff,\\n\\nBefore you write off the stage, a few things to think about.\\n\\n1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \\nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \\ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \\nrepairs.\\n\\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \\nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \\ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \\nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \\nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \\nonsite.\\n\\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \\nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\\n\\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \\nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\\n\\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \\ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\\n\\n\\nSales Price  705,000\\n\\n1st Lien   473,500\\n\\n2nd Lien  225,000\\n\\nTransfer fee    7,500\\n\\nCash required   14,500\\n\\n\\nNOI   100,000\\n\\n1st Lien    47,292\\n\\n2nd Lien   23,694\\n\\nCash flow  29,014\\n\\nCash on cash  200%\\n\\n\\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \\ncash on cash return would be more like 300%.

Cash Needs\\nHighlights:\\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\\nplete=20\\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\\ns=20\\nand other measures.=20\\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\\n.8=20\\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\\nII. Credit Relationships\\nHighlights:\\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\\nlt.=20\\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\\nnd=20\\npayable.\\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\\n=20\\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\\nits=20\\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\\n=20\\nissues within the last three weeks.\\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\\nHighlights\\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\\n such=20\\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\\nHighlights\\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\\n=20\\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\\nTotal                                             $ 460\\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\\n=20\\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\\nom=20\\ncontract employees.\\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\\n=20\\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\\nActivity)\\nHighlights:\\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\\n=20\\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\\ne=20\\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\\n=20\\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\\nD.01-01-018.\\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\\nTURN Proposal\\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\\nRN=20\\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\\ns.=20\\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\\nt=20\\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\\nift=20\\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\\n the=20\\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\\nin=20\\nthe TRA is overstated.\\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\\nHighlights:\\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\\n=20\\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\\n=20\\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\\n=20\\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\\non=20\\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\\nve=20\\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\\n[there is no Section VII]\\n=20\\nVIII.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \\ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \\nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \\nwhat, I\\'m not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \\nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \\nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \\n(and maybe earlier).\\n\\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \\nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \\nsome assurances of payment. \\n\\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \\non 2/2/01.\\n\\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E\\'s \\npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \\n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \\nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \\noccurred today.\\n\\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \\nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \\nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg\\'s new bill .

Note that the\\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\\nstandard rate of 10%.

Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\\n\\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.

The rental rates that we project are\\n$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\\nbedroom.

In attendance were Ken Lay, \\nthe Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \\nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \\nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \\nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \\nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \\nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \\nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \\nproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \\nbased on the governor\\'s comments:\\n\\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \\nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \\ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \\ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \\nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \\nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \\ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \\nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \\nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \\nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \\n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \\nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \\nthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.\\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \\nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \\ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \\ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \\nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \\nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \\nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \\nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \\npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \\nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \\nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \\nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \\ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \\nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \\nwas a frequently recurring theme.\\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \\nbasis to consumers.\\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \\nCalifornia.\\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \\nwidely deploy distributed generation.\\nExpand in-state gas production.\\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \\naddtional gas supplies.\\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \\nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \\nany one time.\\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \\nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should be \\nable to help out here).\\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \\nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \\nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \\nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \\napproach with generators.\\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I\\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\\'s \\nthoughts and get them to Kari)\\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \\nnot just the 5 one year strips.\\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \\ndeal.\\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \\nforward contracting issues.\\nThanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=\\nr the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =\\nin 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=\\nrter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=\\n4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions=\\n and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=\\ne third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=\\nompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =\\nshare on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, in=\\ncremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat=\\nions(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete=\\n inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-ta=\\nx) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan=\\ncing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated =\\nwith certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 m=\\nillion (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of=\\n the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; a=\\nnd a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately=\\n 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components=\\n business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensat=\\nion from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nor=\\ntel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third qu=\\narter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   \"Revenues f=\\nor the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=\\ndjusted to new levels of spending,\" said John Roth, president and chief exe=\\ncutive officer Nortel Networks. \"Our bottom line results reflected the impa=\\nct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=\\ne third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=\\nt its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=\\n Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=\\nreak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=\\nre is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.\"   Frank Dunn, =\\nthe Company\\'s new president and chief executive officer effective November =\\n1, 2001, said, \"Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=\\nation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks=\\n, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=\\nd voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=\\networks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=\\nms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=\\nortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=\\n them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=\\nions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=\\ntunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=\\ns included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to =\\npacket         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =\\nsoftswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe =\\nand         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP,=\\n MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G=\\n Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the fir=\\nst commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP c=\\nall;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =\\n       Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        =\\n Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=\\ned software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =\\n        solution.\"    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =\\nto have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=\\nf its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=\\ns are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =\\nworkforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=\\ner of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=\\ne to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=\\nr of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=\\n the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=\\ntimately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =\\nquarter, Frank Dunn said, \"We are extremely pleased with the results that h=\\nave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=\\ncant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=\\nns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=\\n completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=\\n, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=\\nons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=\\nced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=\\ns we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=\\ns well positioned.\"   \"While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=\\nations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=\\ne levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=\\nncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=\\nke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=\\nsinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=\\nrter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,\" concluded Dunn.         R=\\nevenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=\\nues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=\\n quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =\\nand slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =\\nin Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=\\nrope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=\\nurope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=\\n revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =\\nLatin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=\\nic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=\\nmpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=\\nargely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=\\ny solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=\\nd 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=\\nbstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=\\nrong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=\\nines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=\\nless OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =\\nOctober 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=\\nrks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=\\nl evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =\\nin the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =\\nof 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=\\nted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=\\nnd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=\\n revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=\\n9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=\\ng operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=\\nS$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=\\nion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in=\\n 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=\\n, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=\\n and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=\\nible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=\\n$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=\\n Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=\\nost structure. Compared to the Company\\'s year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=\\nusive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company\\'s cost structure a=\\nt the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=\\non.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =\\napproximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=\\n750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=\\nected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=\\ning the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=\\nss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=\\nred to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=\\nnses    Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the third =\\nquarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=\\njustments and further decline in some of our of customers\\' financial condit=\\nion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=\\nated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=\\nisions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =\\nto second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=\\nearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=\\nrter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=\\no drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=\\nion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=\\n R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=\\n million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=\\ns.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (\"NNL\"), Nortel Ne=\\ntworks Corporation\\'s principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=\\n into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =\\ntraded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=\\nharge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=\\nce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=\\neamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=\\npproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=\\ns Components business.

              " '\\nEarlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.\\n \\nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\\n \\nIf you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\\n \\nThank you for your support.\\n \\nEnron Global Technology\\n \\n \\n \\n-----Original Message----- \\nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration \\nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \\nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON \\nCc: \\nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\\n\\n\\n\\nEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\\n\\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\\n\\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\\n\\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\\n\\nWe will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.\\n\\nThank you for participation, cooperation and support. \\n\\nEnron Messaging Administration',\n",
              " \"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:\\n\\n\\tISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).\\n\\tAny unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).\\n\\tInformation related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).\\n\\nAll in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.

You\\'ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =\\nplayers just like yourself!   =09\\n\\n\\n  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=\\n start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=\\nrry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =\\nStaley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=\\nr - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he\\'s a must- start agai=\\nnst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=\\nnd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=\\n not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we\\'d have t=\\no go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =\\ngoing with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=\\nnswer your second question, we\\'d recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=\\nina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It\\'s tough to choose Davis, but=\\n Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=\\n best, so our hands are tied.  =09\\n\\n\\n  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=\\nis week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=\\ne. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=\\nent from a Fantasy perspective, so we\\'d have to side with Weinke. He\\'ll be =\\nfacing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=\\n like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=\\nig game.  =09\\n\\n\\n  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=\\nnon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=\\nohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=\\nailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre\\'s favorite target i=\\nn the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=\\nrpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=\\nghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =\\ncurrent pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he\\'s just not =\\ngood enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=\\n will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=\\nother No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=\\nntasy player.  =09\\n\\n\\n    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =\\ngiving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=\\nn the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=\\nfter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=\\n will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09\\n\\n\\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

              " 'Don\\'t know if you saw this already.  Interesting.\\n\\nKen\\n\\nIndigestion \\nDaniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 \\n\\nAll those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.\\nFor natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE\\'s Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation\\'s growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. \\n\\nAh, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation\\'s electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. \\n\\nStudness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there\\'s plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. \\n\\nCoal\\'s advantage over gas: It\\'s cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. \\n\\n \\nAddressing a Burning Issue \\nIf natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  \\n  \\n\\nWINNERS  \\t\\t\\tSales* ($bil) \\tRemarks \\nCalpine \\t\\t\\t\\t$4.6 \\t\\tIts gas power plants won\\'t compete with coal for years \\nChesapeake Energy \\t\\t0.9 \\t\\tHedged gas production through December 2003 \\nDynegy \\t\\t\\t43.4 \\t\\tOwns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas \\nPeabody Energy \\t\\t2.7 \\t\\tWorld\\'s largest coal company \\n\\nLOSERS  \\t\\t\\tSales* ($bil) \\tRemarks \\nDevon Energy \\t\\t\\t3.3 Gas-heavy; \\t$8 billion in ...debt  \\nGeneral Electric \\t\\t129.5 \\t\\tSells gas turbines \\nPioneer Natural Resources \\t1.0 \\t\\t$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas \\nTransocean SedcoForex \\t1.9 \\t\\t$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure \\n   \\n*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. \\n\\n\"It\\'s not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It\\'s our game to displace older gas.\" \\n\\nCombined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. \\n\\nThat scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy\\'s 35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. \\n\\nBut coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. \\n\\nLong term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire. \\n\\n\\n',\n",

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=\\nercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=\\nn, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company\\'s return on e=\\nquity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=\\nected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=\\n of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =\\nSeptember 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=\\nertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=\\nns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=\\nnsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =\\nof these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=\\n-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=\\n September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=\\ny, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=\\n of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=\\ne company\\'s offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =\\nexpenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company\\'s offices, extra =\\noperating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=\\ned. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=\\n will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=\\nludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=\\nsset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=\\nganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=\\nn certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=\\nns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=\\nocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=\\nted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=\\ntion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=\\nf improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=\\nted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=\\nities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=\\n on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=\\nr and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =\\n  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=\\ntime costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =\\n19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=\\nnt. The company\\'s adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   \"While we w=\\nere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=\\nrist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =\\nwe saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=\\nestment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=\\nairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. \"In light of =\\nthe weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=\\n our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=\\nitiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=\\nes with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=\\nnefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=\\nhise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=\\n the economy.\"   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=\\ne of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=\\n year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=\\n million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=\\nd in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=\\ne costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=\\ntacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS\\' net income =\\nwould have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=\\near.   TRS\\' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=\\nues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =\\n28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=\\nase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=\\ne September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=\\nr was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=\\net a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=\\narge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=\\nlds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=\\nuctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=\\n.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =\\nhigher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=\\nncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=\\nin marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=\\n expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=\\nss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=\\ning and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results \"=\\non a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=\\nich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=\\nlts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=\\nrmats.   On a reported basis, TRS\\' results included securitization gains of=\\n $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=\\nillion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=\\nse gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=\\n therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=\\nan Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =\\nmillion, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=\\n Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=\\n62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=\\nd earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=\\ns directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA\\'s net inc=\\nome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=\\nsults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =\\nthe investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =\\nlower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=\\nagement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=\\ning the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=\\n primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=\\ncontrol initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=\\n company\\'s $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=\\nies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=\\nion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=\\nlio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=\\nrted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=\\nncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=\\n ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=\\nng these charges, AEB\\'s net income would have been $15 million, approximate=\\nly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=\\nustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=\\n, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=\\nsts did not impact AEB\\'s quarterly results.   AEB\\'s business results reflec=\\nt strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=\\nsults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =\\nas a result of AEB\\'s reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=\\ngher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=\\nalances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =\\nto shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=\\nrporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=\\nillion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=\\nre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =\\nAmerican Express Company (http://www.americanexpress.com ), founded in 1850=\\n, is a global travel, financial and network services provider.

              " 'Phillip,\\n\\nWhich one should I do, the 8x12 is half the price.\\n\\nJeff\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Mel Nelson [mailto:nelsonm@whitehallsd.k12.wi.us]\\nSent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 7:06 AM\\nTo: Richter, Jeff\\nSubject: \\n\\n\\nOctober 17, 2001\\n\\nJeff:\\n\\nI talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in \\nhaving our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you \\nwould like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are \\ndurable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner \\nis rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only \\ncharged for the materials.\\n\\nOur most popular size and style is the 8\\' x 12\\' barn . This is the most \\neconomical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a \\ngiven site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar \\nstyle grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have \\nusually build them with a 3\\'-10 1/2\" wide door opening.  I would think that \\nwould be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your \\ndad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold \\nover 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually \\nvaries between $800 and $900.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is \\na bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum \\nsoffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe \\nPronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize \\nand legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your \\ndad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.\\nThe picture I am attaching shows a common 3\\' entry door.  We are presently \\nbuilding a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6\\' wide roll up \\ndoor.  The price on a 10\\' x 12\\' shed with a 6\\' wide roll-up door would be \\nroughly $1500.\\n\\n\\nWe will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your \\nneeds.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the \\neasiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday \\nOctober 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to \\nfinish that one on time.\\n\\nIf you have any questions just e-mail me or call:\\n\\tWhitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364\\n\\tMy Home number 715-985-3063.\\n\\nHave a good one and take with you later.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMel Nelson',\n",

              " \"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.\\n\\nCalculation of Receipt Point Capacity\\nTopock  540 mmcf/d\\nEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/d\\nNeedles 800 mmcf/d\\nWheeler 800 mmcf/d\\n\\nNew Receipt Points\\nKramer Junction 200 mmcf/d\\nHector Rd 50 mmcf/d\\nBoth will be available around Feb 1\\n\\nBasis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation\\nCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.\\n\\nNew Calculation, Changes and Display\\nBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.\\n\\nOFO Declaration\\nName changes from overnomination\\nCan declare before any Cycle\\nProvide 2 hour notice\\nPost on Gas Select\\nShow OFO Calculation on Gas Select\\n\\nWindows\\nReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system\\nCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   \\nDue to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  \\nReplace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's\\nNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.\\n\\nScheduling Changes-Nov 1\\nGas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     \\nRollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle\\nCopy confirmed noms\\nAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.\\n\\n2 Hour Notice\\nSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.\\nOFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  \\n\\nScheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO\\nNominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  \\nExpected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.\\nNo interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.\\nUse Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules\\nExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.\\nFlow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  \\nIf call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.\\nMany people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  \\nIf OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:\\n\\nCycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut\\nCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut\\nCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut\\nWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles.

This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.\\n\\nStrategic Asset  Development\\nLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.\\n\\nCentral Origination and Mid-Market\\nFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. \\n \\n\\nThere will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. \\n\\nPlease join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.\\n\\nLouise & John',\n",

              " \"\\nToday we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \\n\\nJeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.\\n\\nI know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\\n\\nPlease join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.\",\n",

Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.
